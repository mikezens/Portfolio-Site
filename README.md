## Portfolio Site

A git project for my personal portfolio site.

*Note: Much of what's found here is probably highly-pointed to my needs, fell free to fork and customize away.*

#### Install Instructions
1. Add TypeKit libraries
	* I had to remove this compenent. I am using [Proxima Nova](https://typekit.com/fonts/proxima-nova) and [Museo Slab](https://typekit.com/fonts/museo-slab).
2. Add SS Social Icons
	* This is a commercial font icon library, I couldn't include it. You can find them here [Symbolset - Social Regular](http://symbolset.com/icons/social-regular). They are only $5 and worth it.
3. Add your Google Analtyics code.
